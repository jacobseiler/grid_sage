make_trees requires (at least) 10 inputs.  Note that cannot just run the vertical trees by itself as the vertical trees are created from the horizontal trees. Hence need all inputs.

SSimPL_dir : This is the directory that contains all the necessary subdirectories which are
   - catalogs
   - grids  
   - halos  
   - run  
   - smooth
   - snapshots  
   - trees
filename_halo_version_root : Root name for the halos
filename_trees_name : Root name for the trees to be output.
i_read_start : Snapshot start. (Not used for vertical)
i_read_stop : Snapshot end. (Not used for vertical)
i_read_step : Snapshot step. (Not used for vertical)
n_search : Idk (Not used for vertical) (Check with Greg)
flag_fix_bridges : Flag to fix the bridges xD (Not used for vertical) (Check with Greg)
box_size : Size of Box [Mpc/h] (Not used in vertical)
n_dim_files : The cube root of the number of files.  So if we're splitting the box into a 3x3x3 grid n_dim_files = 3.
